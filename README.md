# Onlinebank-v2
This was my first small one file project more than 2000 lines bcoz I was learning java in the starting stage only at that time I don't know much about database so I used file system to save the data.
And this is the v2 version.Checkout the OnlineBank-v1 as well.

Its all funny whose gonna use filestorage for the banking application everyone will use database right but I don't know anything about github,database.Bcoz it
was my first application in the 2nd sem at that time java was teaching in our college so while learning I used to code that application.

I have used FTP server ,I thought that I can host it from any other hosting.
So I've used FTP server android app and connected the PC through wifi/usb tethering.
You can find the FTP server app link on the youtube video link below.
I have added all the bank features you can find the video link here.
